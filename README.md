# My Zig Learning Journey for 2026

I've been getting deeper into the zig programming language and wanted to dive deeper into understanding this fascinating language. I love the interoperability of ziglang and wish to further advance my understanding of the core library to better understand how to write zig code. I think my current understanding of zig is similar to how my understanding of C++ was and am naming this repository in homage to my learncpp.com journey: my-learnzpp-journey.

I hope to reflect some of the work I did in my learncpp for my learning process, but with more emphasis on building projects instead of reading 200 ways to do the same thing with 21 different functions... Toy projects I would like to be able to build after my journey would be my zigos, nostrum, and cli-template-zig projects. I suspect this learning journey will take about 6 months at most, but I'll try and finish it in 3. Then I can work on my zigos, then nostrum, then my cli-template-zig project, in that order. My planner will have to wait until 2027...

Below is a detailed outline of what I plan to do for my study materials:

. Go through the entire documentation for the Zig Build System: https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/
. Go through the Overview of the language: https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/
. Go through the code examples in ziglang: https://ziglang.org/learn/samples/
. Go through the ziglings exercises: https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/#ziglings
. Go through the openmymind learning zig guide: https://www.openmymind.net/learning_zig/
. Go through the online zig-book: https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book
. Go through the Systems Programming with Zig book that I bought with an estimated release date of Fall 2026
. Go through the entirety of the Zig Language Reference: https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/
. Read through the entirety of the Zig Standard Library: https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/

Concepts I would like to understand how to do in Zig are below
